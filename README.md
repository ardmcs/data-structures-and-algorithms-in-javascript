## To-do

[ ] - Add unit test cases for Algorithms

[ ] - Clean up code comments

[ ] - Add README for every section

## Additional Pointers to focus on studying

1. Depth First Search

2. Breath First Search

3. Binary search

4. Matching Parenthesis

5. Hash Tables

6. Variables/Pointers manipulation

7. Reverse linked list (duplicates , removing duplicates)

8. Sorting fundamentals (quicksort, mergesort, bubblesort techniques, runtime of a sort, time space complexity)

9. Recursion

10. Custom Data Structures (OOP, Stacks, Heaps, Queue, Linked Lists, Binary Trees)
